#  **smart .note** 

## **General Info**
- **smart .note** is an application for saving notes. The application is designed to run in a local network and provide options like new note creation, adding reminders, upload/download files and senting notes and files via email. I used C# and I created the app in Visual Studio 2019. Regarding the database I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18.

- I created that project to discover the features provided by windows forms and be familiar with them. 
- How to run the project.
